# Verdure Landscape Design Example

This directory contains a sample application demonstrating a Flutter client interacting with a Python-based A2A (Agent-to-Agent) server for landscape design.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK
- Python 3.13 or higher
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- A Gemini API Key
  - You can create one using [AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/aistudio).

## Running the Example

To run this example, you need to start both the server and the client application.

### 1. Start the Server

a. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd examples/verdure/server/verdure
   ```

b. Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key:

   ```bash
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" > .env
   ```
   *Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key.*

c. Install dependencies and run the server using UV:

   ```bash
   uv run .
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:10002` by default.

   * Troubleshooting `uv run .` command:

      If `uv run .` fails with a `401 Unauthorized` error while fetching a package
      from `us-python.pkg.dev/...`, the committed `uv.lock` is pinned to a private
      package index you don't have credentials for. Regenerate it against public
      PyPI:

      ```bash
      cd examples/verdure/server
      rm uv.lock
      uv lock
      ```

      Then re-run `uv run .` from the `server/verdure` directory.

d. In a new terminal window, verify the server is responding as expected:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:10002/.well-known/agent-card.json
   ```

### 2. Run the Client

a. Open a new terminal window.

b. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

c. Run the Flutter application on your desired device:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

The Flutter application will connect to the server running on `localhost:10002` to interact with the landscape design agent.

### Running on an Android Emulator

When running the client on an Android emulator, you need to start the server with a special flag to ensure the emulator can connect to it. This is because the Android emulator uses `10.0.2.2` as an alias for the host machine's `localhost`.

1.  **Start the Server with the `--base-url` flag:**

    In the `server/verdure` directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    uv run . --base-url="http://10.0.2.2:10002"
    ```

    This tells the server to advertise its agent card with the emulator-accessible IP address, even though it still binds to `localhost`.

2.  **Run the Client:**

    Follow the standard instructions to run the client. The client code is already configured to use `http://10.0.2.2:10002` when it detects it's running on an Android emulator.

    ```bash
    cd client
    flutter run -d emulator
    ```

## Disclaimer

Important: The sample code provided is for demonstration purposes and illustrates the mechanics of the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. When building production applications, it is critical to treat any agent operating outside of your direct control as a potentially untrusted entity.

All data received from an external agent—including but not limited to its AgentCard, messages, artifacts, and task statuses—should be handled as untrusted input. Failure to properly validate and sanitize this data before use can introduce security vulnerabilities into your application.

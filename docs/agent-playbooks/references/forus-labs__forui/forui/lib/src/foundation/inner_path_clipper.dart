/// A [CustomClipper] that clips to the inner path of a [Decoration].

/// The inner path is the region inside the decoration's border, following any rounded corners. Useful for clipping
/// a decorated box's child so it doesn't overlap the border ring.
///
/// * For [ShapeDecoration], this uses `shape.getInnerPath(...)`.
/// * For [BoxDecoration], the inner path is assembled from the decoration's `border.dimensions`, `borderRadius`, and
///   `shape` — [BoxBorder.getInnerPath] is not used because it ignores `BoxDecoration.borderRadius`.
/// * For other [Decoration] types, falls back to the outer path via [Decoration.getClipPath].
